- Change how ruby class variables are generated in rsclass-rb when :render_as_rb_class_constant is false. They should be generated as in Grrr::Grrr.
- Change ALL_RUBY_CONSTANTS to class variables to comply with SuperCollider class variables and not cause ruby warnings when changed.
- Remove Caps Lock modifier functionality completely since it is inconsistent. Investigate whether Caps Lock is not working on all platforms: not working on Grrr-sc SC3.6 Win7 (Qt) caps not detected, grrr-rb JRuby Win7 caps detected but not working due to a physically held key retriggers key press and released all the time
- Move modifiers in prConfigureKeyboardActions to keymaps
- Consider removing all occurences of info in GRController and Grrr::Controller and any subclasses of these classes and moving the info to documentation instead
- Fix readme classes section
- GRMultiXView bugs, these do not work as expected:
	flash
	flashView
	flashPoint
	flashPoints
- Review all TODOs in Grrr-sc and grrr-rb
- Implement tap (== press then instant release)
- Document everything!
- Implement step_sequencer_view
